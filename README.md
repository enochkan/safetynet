<!-- <p align="center">A Python Machine Learning Security Toolbox for Adversarial Attacks. Works with LLMs, DNNs, and other machine learning algorithms.</p> -->

## What is Plexiglass?

Plexiglass is a Python toolbox designed for penetration testing against adversarial attacks in machine learning. This toolbox includes a command-line interface (CLI) tool named `plx`, and it can also be imported as a library in Python applications.

Plexiglass's Python library has two modules: LLMs and DNNs. For LLMs, plexiglass uses [litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) under the hood. 

We are working tirelessly to include more frameworks and attack/ defense mechanisms for testing. Please read our [docs](https://kortex-labs.github.io/plexiglass/build/html/index.html) for the latest updates.

## What is Adversarial Machine Learning?

Adversarial machine learning involves manipulating input data to deceive machine learning models. In deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs), attacks include adding subtly modified inputs that cause incorrect model predictions or responses. These attacks exploit model vulnerabilities, testing their robustness and security.

## Installation

The first experimental release is version `0.0.1`.

To download the package from PyPi:

`pip install --upgrade plexiglass`

## Getting Started

### PLX

Plexiglass has a CLI called `plx`.

Simply run `plx --help` to get started.

### Feature Request
To request new features, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/enochkan/plexiglass/issues)

### Local Development

To get started

```python
make develop
```

this will clean, build, and install the package locally for development purpose.
