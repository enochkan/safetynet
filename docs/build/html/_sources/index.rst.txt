Plexiglass
==========

Plexiglass is an innovative toolbox designed to test vulnerabilities and safeguard Language Learning Models (LLMs), developed by Kortex Labs. This Python-based security toolbox operates with a focus on the rigorous testing and enhancement of security measures for LLMs.

Key Features
------------

- **Security-focused LLM Toolbox**: Plexiglass is crafted as a security toolbox specifically for testing and safeguarding LLMs, making it an essential tool for developers working with these models.

- **Versatile Testing Modes**: It offers two primary modes of operation: `llm-chat` and `llm-scan`. The `llm-chat` mode enables interactive conversations with LLMs, allowing the assessment of predefined metrics like toxicity in responses. Meanwhile, the `llm-scan` mode is designed to run tests to identify and evaluate various vulnerabilities within LLMs.

- **Ease of Use**: Users can begin using Plexiglass simply by installing it and running `plx --help` for guidance, emphasizing user-friendliness and accessibility.

- **Open-Source and Community-Driven**: Plexiglass is an open-source project, encouraging community contributions and feedback. This collaborative approach ensures continuous improvement and adaptation to emerging security needs in LLMs.

- **First Release and Installation**: The first experimental release of Plexiglass is version `0.0.1`, available for download from PyPi. Users can easily install it using the command `pip install --upgrade plexiglass`.

Inspiration and Compatibility
------------------------------

- The development of Plexiglass is motivated by the increasing importance of security in machine learning and AI. It aligns with the current trend of creating robust and secure AI systems, especially in the realm of language learning models.

- Plexiglass uses `litellm` under the hood, suggesting compatibility with a range of LLMs and providing a versatile tool for developers and researchers in the field.

Community Involvement
---------------------

- Kortex Labs emphasizes the importance of community involvement in Plexiglass's development. They are actively seeking contributors to further enrich the toolbox and extend its capabilities.
